"""Permutation test for the matched-pair single-turn design.

``stage2.analyze.stats.permutation_test_auroc`` reassigns whole *blocks* of
outcomes between tasks (matched by block length) — the right null when
different tasks carry different outcome patterns, which is true for agentic
rollouts (a task's resolved/unresolved mix across seeds varies). It is
**degenerate here**: every DebugBench problem contributes the same fixed
pair by construction (one ``outcome=1`` original row, one ``outcome=0``
corrupted row per variant), so swapping identical blocks between problems
never changes anything — the block-swap p-value is pinned at 1.0 regardless
of signal strength (confirmed empirically: AUROC ~1.0 on synthetic separable
data still returned p=1.0 with the block-swap version).

The appropriate null for a matched-pair/small-group design is a **within-task
label permutation**: for each task, shuffle which of *that task's own* rows
carry which outcome label (preserving the task's own count of 1s/0s), so the
score-to-label pairing is actually perturbed. For the 1-vs-1 per-variant
frame this is exactly a 50/50 paired sign-flip; for the pooled frame (one
original vs. several corrupted rows per task) it permutes which row within
the task is treated as "original".
